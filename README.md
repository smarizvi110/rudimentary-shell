# Rudimentary Shell in C** 

## ~September 2024

A project I used to learn using C, Operating Systems, and Process Management.

- Implements core functionalities such as command parsing, built-in commands, and process control.  
- Supports external command execution to enable interaction with various system commands.  
- Implements features for chaining commands and piping between commands (supported separately).
